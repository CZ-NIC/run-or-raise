# Here you list all the shortcuts.
#
# The shortcuts may be defined in two ways:
#
# 1. Run-or-raise form: shortcut,launch-command,[wm_class],[title]
#        * wm_class and title are optional and case sensitive
#        * if none is set, lowercased launch-command is compared with lowercased windows wm_classes and titles
#
# 2. Run only form: shortcut,calculate

# This line cycles any open gnome-terminal (matched by wm_class = Gnome-terminal on Ubuntu 17.10) OR if not found, launches new one.
# If you're using Arch, you may want to match by wm_class = gnome-terminal-server , just check yourself by Alt+F2/lg/Windows

# You may use regular expression in title or wm_class.
# Just put the regular expression between slashes.
# E.g. to jump to pidgin conversation window you may use this line
# (that means any windows of wm_class Pidgin, not containing the title Buddy List)"
